## CRITICAL ISSUES (IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED)

### 1. **CONTRADICTORY NOTIFICATION TIMELINES** üö®
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Legal compliance failure, customer trust erosion

**Issue:** Multiple conflicting breach notification commitments across documents:
- **Legal Policy:** 24-hour customer notification
- **DPA:** "Without undue delay" and 72-hour GDPR notification
- **Incident Response Plan:** 24-hour customer notification
- **MSA:** "Without undue delay"

**Recommendation:** Standardize to 24-hour customer notification across ALL documents. Update DPA Section 6.1 to align with Legal Policy commitment.

### 2. **INCONSISTENT LOG RETENTION PERIODS** üö®
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Audit failure, forensic capability gaps

**Issue:** Conflicting log retention requirements:
- **Legal Policy:** 90-day minimum for security logs
- **Data Management Policy:** ‚â•365 days for internal audit logs
- **Access Control Policy:** ‚â•365 days for privileged access logs

**Recommendation:** Clarify distinction between customer-facing security logs (90 days) vs. internal compliance audit logs (365 days). Update all policies with clear categorization.

### 3. **MISSING CRITICAL SUBPROCESSOR IN LEGAL POLICY** üö®
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Customer misrepresentation, compliance gap

**Issue:** Legal Policy Section 8.1 lists subprocessors but omits **Customer.io** (email communications), which is included in DPA Appendix 3 and FAQ documents.

**Recommendation:** Update Legal Policy Section 8.1 immediately to include Customer.io.

### 4. **UNDEFINED "CRITICAL SLA THRESHOLD" IN MSA** üö®
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Unenforceable contract terms

**Issue:** MSA Section 1.4 references "critical SLA thresholds" but SLA document defines different thresholds for different tiers without clear mapping to MSA termination rights.

**Recommendation:** Define specific numerical thresholds in MSA or reference SLA Exhibit B Section 11 explicitly.

### 5. **CLOUD PROXY DEPENDENCY NOT DISCLOSED IN FAQ** üö®
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Customer misunderstanding, technical misrepresentation

**Issue:** FAQ documents don't adequately explain that BYOK configurations still require cloud proxy services for protocol translation and policy enforcement.
