## Detailed Responses to IMC Questions

### 1. Underlying Code / Training Data

#### Q: Are any sources of code/data used to train or fine-tune AI models (open-source, proprietary, third-party licensed)?

**Answer:** 
- **No customer or open-source code is used for training**. We exclusively use synthetic datasets for AI model training.
- Our models are distilled from established foundation models using privacy-preserving techniques
- We do not scrape, collect, or train on:
  - Open-source repositories (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
  - Customer proprietary code
  - Third-party licensed code
- This approach eliminates IP contamination risks and ensures clean model provenance

---

### 2. Ownership

#### Q: Who owns the inputs we provide (e.g., proprietary code, client data)?

**Answer:**
- **IMC retains 100% ownership** of all inputs including:
  - Proprietary code
  - Client data
  - Documentation
  - Any other materials provided to Pieces
- This is explicitly stated in our Master Service Agreement (MSA) and Data Processing Addendum (DPA)
- No license grant to Pieces beyond what's necessary to provide the service

#### Q: Does Pieces claim any rights to outputs (AI-suggested code, refactoring recommendations), or are they fully customer-owned?

**Answer:**
- **All outputs are fully IMC-owned**, including:
  - AI-generated code suggestions
  - Refactoring recommendations  
  - Analysis results
  - Any derivative works
- Pieces claims no rights, license, or ownership to any outputs
- Outputs can be used without restriction or attribution

#### Q: Can customer data be used for model improvement?

**Answer:**
- **No, not without explicit opt-in consent**
- Default setting: Customer data is never used for model improvement
- For IMC's enterprise deployment:
  - We can contractually guarantee no data usage for model training
  - Complete exclusion from any improvement programs
  - Audit trail of this exclusion maintained

---

### 3. Leakage / Data Privacy

#### Q: Is Pieces local-first/offline, or does data flow to cloud servers?

**Answer:**
- **Pieces operates with configurable hybrid architecture**

**Default Blended Mode (~85% on-device, ~15% cloud processing):**
- ALL data persistence on developer machines
- Cloud provides ephemeral LLM inference only
- Zero retention of cloud-processed data
- Results immediately stored locally

**Configuration Options for IMC:**
- **Blended Mode:** Cloud LLM for enhanced AI (ephemeral I/O only)
- **SSO-Locked:** Restrict to IMC-approved cloud models
- **BYOK:** Use IMC's existing GCP/OpenAI/Claude licenses (**Important:** BYOK still requires our cloud proxy services for secure protocol translation and policy enforcement)
- **Air-Gapped:** 100% offline operation (no internet required)
- Can be configured org-wide or per-user/team

**Minimal Cloud Metadata (<1% - operational only):**
- Authentication state (SSO tokens)
- Crash analytics metadata (PII scrubbed)
- Abstract usage metrics (opt-in, anonymized)
- License validation
- Abuse detection signals

**Ephemeral Cloud Processing (Zero Storage):**
- Pure I/O operation for LLM inference
- Input â†’ Compute â†’ Output â†’ Delete
- No persistence of prompts or responses
- Unless IMC explicitly requests audit logging

#### Q: Policies on data transmission, encryption, and storage?

**Answer:**

**Encryption:**
- Transit: TLS 1.3 (all communications)
- At Rest: AES-256 encryption
- Key Management: Google Cloud KMS with automated rotation
- Option for Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK)

**Data Transmission:**
- All transmissions over encrypted channels
- No data leaves device in local-only mode
- Cloud sync only with explicit user action

**Storage:**
- Local: Device-encrypted storage
- Cloud: Google Cloud Platform (us-east5 - Ohio)
- Regional options available (including Sydney/Australia)
- 35-day backup retention with encryption

#### Q: Are subprocessors used? If so, where are they located?

**Answer:**

**Infrastructure (Core):**
- Google Cloud Platform (USA, with Sydney region available)
- GitHub Enterprise (USA) - code/development only, no customer data

**Operational Services (No customer code/data processed):**
- **Paddle** (UK/USA) - Payment processing as Merchant of Record

### 4. Learning Capabilities

#### Q: Does Pieces learn from customer data (fine-tuning, embeddings, federated learning)?

**Answer:**
- **No learning from IMC data without explicit consent**
- Our approach:
  - Base models use only synthetic data
  - No fine-tuning on customer data
  - Embeddings stay local to user/organization
  - No federated learning across customers
- IMC-specific configuration:
  - Complete isolation from other customers
