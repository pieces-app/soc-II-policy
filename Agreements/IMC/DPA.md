together hereinafter 'Controller',

and

2. Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. (d/b/a pieces.app), a Delaware corporation with its principal business office at 1311 Vine Street, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202, United States, represented by Tsavo Knott, CEO, hereinafter 'Processor' and, together with Controller, hereinafter the 'Parties';

WHEREAS:

1. Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (hereinafter: ‘GDPR’), any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person is defined as ‘personal data’, hereinafter: ‘Personal Data’.  
     
2. Controller has instructed Processor to provide services to Controller, whereby Processor processes Personal Data on behalf of and on account of Controller;  
     
3. Controller and Processor have confirmed their agreements regarding the processing of Personal Data by Processor as instructed Controller into this Data Processing Agreement hereinafter: ‘Data Processing Agreement’.

THEREFORE, THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:

**Article 1	Subject of this Data Processing Agreement**

1.1	This Data Processing Agreement applies to the services and activities carried out by Processor on behalf of Controller under the Statement of Work dated \[DATE\] for Pilot Implementation, in connection with providing Pieces software \- a proprietary artificial memory system (95% proprietary code) across the operating system consisting of: (i) Pieces Desktop Application, (ii) Pieces OS runtime (on-device processing engine), (iii) minimal cloud infrastructure services (\<1% of data processing), and (iv) open-source IDE/tool integrations. The system enhances contextual awareness and productivity for developers, AI agents, agentic tools via MCP (Model Context Protocol), internal tooling, and various organizational roles including HR, Marketing, Project Management, Executive Operations, and other personnel who can benefit from AI-powered memory and context management across their workflows, hereinafter: 'Assignment'.

1.2	This Data Processing Agreement replaces all prior understandings between the Parties about the processing of Personal Data. Where the provisions of this Data Processing Agreement contradict or amend earlier agreements on the processing of Personal Data, the provisions of this Data Processing Agreement prevail unless otherwise expressly provided in this Data Processing Agreement.

1.3	Following this Data Processing Agreement, Processor processes Personal Data on behalf of Controller and under Controller’s responsibility. Controller is responsible for the evaluation of the admissibility of the data processing and for ensuring the rights of the data subjects concerned.

1.4	Processor processes Personal Data exclusively for the purposes following execution of the Assignment as detailed in **Appendix A**.

1.5	Processor will process Personal Data only in accordance with the instructions of Controller and its affiliated entities. Processor has no independent control of Personal Data that it processes. Processor may not process Personal Data for its own purpose or benefit, the benefit of third parties or other purposes, except with Controller’s prior written consent or where required by law. Copies or duplicates of any Personal Data made available hereunder may only be compiled with the approval of Controller.

1.6	If Processor is required by law to disclose or otherwise process Personal Data that is not in accordance with the instructions of Controller, Processor will inform Controller of these requirements prior to processing the Personal Data, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.

1.7	Processor will process Personal Data in accordance with the provisions of this Data Processing Agreement and any written instructions received from Controller. Oral instructions have to be confirmed in writing immediately. In addition, Processor warrants and represents that it will process Personal Data in a fair and responsible manner, in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. Written instructions received from Controller may, in particular, amplify, specify, and amend this Data Processing Agreement.

**\[PROPOSED ADDITION \- Article 1.8\]** 1.8	**Architecture Clarification:** The Parties acknowledge that Pieces operates as an artificial memory system across the operating system with a primarily on-device architecture where \>99% of all Personal Data is stored and processed locally on Controller's end-user devices. The system enhances contextual awareness and productivity for Controller's entire organization including developers, AI agents, agentic tools via MCP, internal tooling, HR, Marketing, Project Management, Executive Operations, and other organizational roles. Cloud processing, when utilized, is limited to: (a) minimal operational metadata (\<1% \- authentication tokens, anonymized telemetry), and (b) ephemeral LLM inference operations with zero data retention. Processor has no technical capability to remotely access locally-stored on-device data including code, documents, communications, or organizational knowledge.

**Article 2	Confidentiality**

2.1	Processor shall keep Personal Data confidential and shall not disclose Personal Data in any way to the employees and/or third parties without the prior written consent of Controller, except where: (i) it is necessary that employees and/or third parties need to have knowledge of Personal Data for the purpose of execution of the Assignment; or (ii) it is required by law.

2.2	Processor shall inform Controller of any disclosures of Personal Data to third parties, unless this is prohibited by law.

2.3	Processor shall provide the employees and/or third parties access to Personal Data only to the extent necessary to perform the processing necessary for the execution of the Assignment. Processor will ensure that all employees, other persons and third parties engaged by Processor to process Personal Data on its behalf, comply with the obligations contained in this Data Processing Agreement.  Processor ensures that persons authorised to process Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality and oblige employees not to process or use the relevant personal data without authorization. Any such confidentiality obligations shall continue to be valid after termination of employment with Processor.

**Article 3	Sub-processors**

3.1	Processor may not engage a third party as sub-processor to process Personal Data without Controller’s prior written consent. Such consent shall not be withheld unreasonably.

3.2	Processor enters into a written data processing agreement with all permitted sub-processors. Processor shall ensure that sub-processors are contractually bound by the same or more stringent obligations with respect to the processing of Personal Data as those which Processor is bound by under this Data Processing Agreement.

3.3 	In addition to article 3.1 and 3.2, Controller may, for the assessment of its consent, request Processor to provide a copy of the personal data processing agreement with its sub-processor(s) and change and amend such agreement to the extent reasonable with respect to Personal Data protection.

3.4	Processor will audit sub-processor’s compliance with the contractual and legal requirements on a regular basis, at least twice per calendar year. The audit may be conducted by: (i) requesting a self-disclosure report form the sub-processor; (ii) having an expert providing a respective certificate; and/or (iii) personally auditing the sub-processor’s facilities. Processor will document such audits in writing and submit the respective document to Controller even without explicit request.

3.5	Processor remains fully responsible and liable to Controller for the sub-processor’s performance for complying with its obligations under this Data Processing Agreement, as well as for any acts or omissions of the sub-processor in regards to its processing.

**Article 4	Security and data breaches**

4.7 	Processor will have a process in place for regular testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness if its security measures with regard of Personal Data processing following the Assignment (which will be at least once a year, and based on the ISO/IEC 27000 series or similar standards). The security report will address, in detail, at least: (i) compliance and non-compliance with the technical and organizational security measures; (ii) security incidents; (iii) data breaches; and (iv) recommend improvements.

4.8	Processor will provide Controller with a copy of the latest version of the security report as referred to in article 4.7 without undue delay.
