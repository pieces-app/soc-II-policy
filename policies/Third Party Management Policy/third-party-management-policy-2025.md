# **Third-Party Management Policy** 

**Policy Owner:** Mack Myers (Co-Founder & Corporate Secretary, Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc.), Security/GRC

**Effective Date:** August 19, 2025 

# **Purpose** 

To ensure protection of Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc.'s data and assets that are shared with, accessible to, or managed by suppliers, including external parties or third-party organizations such as service providers, vendors, and customers, and to maintain an agreed level of information security and service delivery in line with supplier agreements.

This document outlines a baseline of security controls that Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. expects partners and other third-party companies to meet when interacting with Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. Confidential data.

# **Scope** 

All data and information systems owned or used by Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. that are business critical and/or process, store, or transmit Confidential data. This policy applies to all employees of Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. and to all external parties, including but not limited to Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. consultants, contractors, business partners, vendors, suppliers, partners, outsourced service providers, and other third-party entities with access to Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. data, systems, networks, or system resources.

# **Policy**

## **Roles & Responsibilities**

- Corporate Secretary (Mack Myers): Owns vendor governance, contract security terms, recordkeeping, and approval workflow.
- Security/GRC (function): Performs security due diligence, risk tiering, reviews external audit reports, and defines compensating controls. Contact: security@pieces.app.
- System Owners/Requestors: Define intended use, data types, required permissions, and ensure least-privilege access.
- HR (airCFO): Co-approves HR/finance-related vendors and ensures agreements align with onboarding/offboarding processes.
- Head of Cloud Infrastructure & Security (Hiro Tamada): Owns cloud service security posture, CSP responsibility-matrix controls, and technical validation of vendor security integrations (SSO/MFA, logging, network, encryption).

Information security requirements for mitigating the risks associated with supplier's access to the organization's assets shall be agreed with the supplier and documented.

For all service providers who may access Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. Confidential data, systems, or networks, proper due diligence shall be performed prior to provisioning access or engaging in processing activities. Information shall be maintained regarding which regulatory or certification requirements are managed by or impacted by each service provider, and which are managed by Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. as required. Applicable regulatory or certification requirements may include ISO 27001, SOC 2, PCI DSS, CCPA, GDPR or other frameworks, compliance standards, or regulations.

# **Information Security in Third-Party Relationships**

## **Addressing Security in Agreements**

Relevant information security requirements shall be established and agreed upon with each supplier that may access, process, store, transmit, or impact the security of Confidential data and systems, or provide physical or virtual IT infrastructure components for Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc.

For all service providers who may access Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. production systems, or who may impact the security of the Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. production environment, written agreements shall be maintained that include the service provider's acknowledgment of their responsibilities for the confidentiality of company and customer data, and any commitments regarding the integrity, availability, and/or privacy controls that they manage in order to meet the standards and requirements that Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. has established in accordance with Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc.â€™s information security program or any relevant framework.

## **Technology Supply Chain**

Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. will consider and assess risk associated with suppliers and the technology supply chain. Where warranted, agreements with suppliers shall include requirements to address the relevant information security risks associated with information and communications technology services and the product supply chain.

## **Vendor Risk Tiering**

Vendors are classified by inherent risk using the following criteria: data sensitivity (e.g., customer data, PII), system criticality, production access, and transaction volume.

- High risk: Access to production systems, customer data, or Confidential data at scale (e.g., cloud/IaaS, IdP, core security tooling). Reassess at least annually and upon a material change.
- Medium risk: Access to limited Confidential data or internal systems with moderate impact (e.g., HRIS, CRM). Reassess at least every 2 years and upon material change.
- Low risk: No access to Confidential data or production systems (e.g., marketing utilities). Reassess on contract renewal or material change.

AI/ML and LLM providers are further evaluated on: model/data usage practices, dataset provenance, evaluation rigor (safety, bias, privacy), prompt/abuse safeguards, and subprocessor GPU/region dependencies.

## **Due Diligence & Security Requirements by Tier**

Prior to access or data sharing, the following evidence is requested proportionate to vendor risk:

- External assurance: SOC 2 Type II report or ISO 27001 certificate (high/medium); SOC 3 or other attestation (low as applicable).
- Technical posture: Penetration test summary (last 12 months), vulnerability management policy/cadence, encryption at rest/in transit, MFA for administrative access, SSO support.
- Privacy & data handling: Data Processing Agreement (if processing personal data), subprocessor list and change notification process, data location/regions, data retention/deletion timelines, breach notification commitments.
- Operational controls: Incident response summary, business continuity/disaster recovery statements, logging/monitoring practices.
- Contractual terms: Right to audit/review security reports, 72-hour breach notification (or sooner if required by law), termination assistance and certified data deletion upon request.

Compensating controls may be applied (e.g., limited scope integrations, tokenization, additional monitoring) where a vendor cannot meet a requirement and the residual risk is acceptable.

## **AI/ML and LLM-Specific Requirements**

When engaging AI/ML or LLM providers or features, Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. requires proportionate controls in addition to baseline due diligence:

- Data usage & retention
  - No training on Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. proprietary or customer data without explicit written approval; default is opt-out from model training and analytics beyond service provision.
  - Clear data retention and deletion timelines; ability to request deletion and receive confirmation within 30 days.
  - Separation of customer/tenant data; confidentiality protections in inputs, outputs, and logs. Redaction of sensitive data in logs where feasible.
- Privacy & legal
  - Executed Data Processing Agreement (if processing personal data), including subprocessor transparency and change notifications.
  - Cross-border data transfer safeguards and declared data residency/regions.
- Security & access
  - SSO/MFA for console and administrative access; role-based permissions; customer-scoped API keys; rate limiting and abuse prevention.
  - Encryption in transit and at rest for prompts, embeddings, and outputs; key management disclosures.
- Model governance & evaluations
  - Provider documentation (e.g., model card or equivalent) including intended use, limitations, and evaluation summaries.
  - Evidence of safety, privacy, and bias testing appropriate to use case; disclosure of jailbreak mitigations and content filtering.
  - Dataset provenance statements for training and fine-tuning; licensing and IP compliance representations.
- Supply chain & operations
  - Disclosure of material subprocessors (including GPU/accelerator providers) and geography.
  - Incident notification within 72 hours (or sooner where required) with commitments to share scope, data impacted, and mitigations.
- Self-hosted/open-source models
  - Container/image provenance and vulnerability scanning; timely patching cadence.
  - Network isolation and egress controls; no external telemetry collection unless approved by Security/GRC.
