# **Code of Conduct**

**Policy Owner:** Katie Storm (AirCFO), Mack Myers (Co-Founder & Corporate Secretary, Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc.)

**Effective Date:** August 19, 2025

# **Purpose** 

The primary goal of Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc.'s Code of Conduct is to foster inclusive, collaborative and safe working conditions for all Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. staff. As such, Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. is committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all staff, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. staff, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

# **Scope** 

The Code of Conduct applies to all Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. staff. This includes full-time, part-time and contractor staff employed at every seniority level. The Code of Conduct is to be upheld during all professional functions and events, including but not limited to business hours at the Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. office, during Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc.-related extracurricular activities and events, while attending conferences and other professional events on behalf of Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc., and while working remotely and communicating on Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. resources with other staff.

We expect all Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. staff to abide by this Code of Conduct in all business matters -- online and in-person -- as well as in all one-on-one communications with customers and staff pertaining to Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. business.

This Code of Conduct also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of business activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. staff and clients.

# **Culture and Citizenship**

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize the relationships between our actions and their effects within Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. culture.

**Be welcoming.** We strive to be a company that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

**Be considerate.** Your work at Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.

**Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a company where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is neither productive nor pleasant. Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. staff should always be respectful when dealing with other personnel as well as with people outside of Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. employment.

# **Acceptable and Expected Behavior**

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. staff:

* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc.

* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions at all times.

* Attempt collaboration before conflict.

* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.

* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

* Remember that Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. events may be shared with members of the public and Mesh Intelligent Technologies, Inc. customers; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations at all times

* Raise concerns through the appropriate channels and provide evidence-based, constructive feedback. Once a decision is made, disagree-and-commit to execution unless new, material information emerges.

* Seek clarification on directives you do not understand before acting. Propose alternatives respectfully and be prepared to execute the approved approach.

* Use company communication channels and devices primarily for business purposes. Keep discussions professional and minimize non-work debates or politics that detract from productivity, respect, and efficiency.

* Promptly disclose actual or potential conflicts of interest to HR (airCFO) or the Corporate Secretary and recuse yourself from related decisions where appropriate.

* Comply with all signed agreements and company policies, including confidentiality/NDA obligations and employment or contractor agreements.

# **Unacceptable Behavior**

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

* Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.

* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.

* Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").

* Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
