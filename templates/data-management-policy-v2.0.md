# **APPENDIX A – Internal Retention and Disposal Procedure[^17]**

\<Company Name\>’s \<responsible party, e.g., Engineering Team\> is responsible for setting and enforcing the data retention and disposal procedures for \<Company Name\> managed accounts and devices.

**Customer Accounts:**

1. Customer accounts and data shall be deleted within \<sixty (60)\> days of contract termination through manual data deletion processes.

**Devices:** 

1. Employee devices will be collected promptly upon an employee’s termination. Remote employees will be sent a shipping label and the return of their device shall be monitored.  
2. Collected devices will be cleared to be re-provisioned—or removed from inventory;, \<Company Name\> will securely erase the device when reprovisioning.  
3. Device images may be retained at the discretion of management for business purposes

**Destroying devices or electronic media**

In cases where a device is damaged in a way that \<Company Name\> cannot access the Recovery Partition to erase the drive, \<Company Name\> may optionally decide to use an E-Waste service that includes data destruction with a certificate. \<Company Name\> will keep certificates of destruction on record for one year. Physical destruction can be optional if it is verified that the device is encrypted with Full Disk Encryption, which would negate the risk of data recovery.

Management will review this procedure at least \<frequency of procedure review, e.g., annually\>.
